## About the Project

PetMatch is a web-based platform designed to help connect individuals and families with the perfect pet for their lifestyle. Our goal is to bridge the gap between those who want to adopt a pet and those pets that are in need of a loving home.

At PetMatch, we understand that adopting a pet is a big decision, and we want to make the process as easy and stress-free as possible. That's why we've developed a comprehensive platform that includes a wide range of tools and resources to help users find and adopt their ideal furry friend.

Our platform uses state-of-the-art AI technology to match pets with their perfect owners based on a wide range of factors, including living situation, lifestyle, and more. This ensures that each adoption is a perfect fit and sets the stage for a long and happy relationship between the pet and its new family.

In addition to our matching technology, we also provide a wealth of resources to help users prepare for and adjust to life with a new pet. From tips and advice on training and care to access to a network of pet professionals, we're here to help every step of the way.

One of our key differentiators is our network of shelters and adoption agencies across Europe. By partnering with these organizations, we're able to connect users with pets that they might not have been able to find otherwise. This also allows us to offer a wider range of pets and breeds than many other adoption platforms.

At PetMatch, we're committed to making the adoption process as seamless and rewarding as possible for both pets and their new owners. Whether you're looking for a loyal companion, a furry playmate for your kids, or a furry friend to share your life with, we're here to help you find the perfect match.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website at https://nodejs.org/.
